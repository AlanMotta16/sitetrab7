                      "Random-access memory (known as RAM) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.
                       A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory,
                       in contrast with other direct-access data storage media (such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory),
                       where the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium,
                       due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement."<br>

                    The main thing people look at when buying RAM is how much is there in each stick? The more things you are doing at one time,
                     the more RAM you are going to need. VRAM (for graphics cards) works in a similar way, but for video.

                    You can have two types, HDD and SSD:<br>
                    <i>
                      "A hard disk drive (HDD), hard disk, hard drive, or fixed disk is an electro-mechanical data storage device
                       that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material.
                       The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces.
                       Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order.
                       HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off.
                       Modern HDDs are typically in the form of a small rectangular box.<br>
                      A solid-state drive (SSD) is a solid-state storage device that uses integrated circuit assemblies to store data persistently,
                       typically using flash memory, and functioning as secondary storage in the hierarchy of computer storage.
                      It is also sometimes called a semiconductor storage device, a solid-state device or a solid-state disk,
                      even though SSDs lack the physical spinning disks and movable read-write heads used in hard disk drives (HDDs) and floppy disks.
                      Compared with electromechanical drives, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run silently, and have higher IOPS and lower latency."<br>

                      "A computer case, also known as a computer chassis, is the enclosure that contains most of the components of a personal computer
                       (usually excluding the display, keyboard, and mouse).
                       Cases are usually constructed from steel (often SECC-steel, electrogalvanized, cold-rolled, coil), aluminium and plastic.
                       Other materials such as glass, wood, acrylic and even Lego bricks have appeared in home-built cases."<br>

                    Cases are where you can get your PC build to look super custom, because you can customize its size, material, and more.
                     You can also have custom lighting (if you're a gamer, it has to be RGB). If you 3D-print the case, it can have a crazy shape.

                    <i>"A power supply unit (PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer.
                       Most modern desktop personal computer power supplies conform to the ATX specification, which includes form factor and voltage tolerances.
                       While an ATX power supply is connected to the mains supply, it always provides a 5-volt standby (5VSB) power so that the standby functions on the computer and certain peripherals are powered.
                       ATX power supplies are turned on and off by a signal from the motherboard.
                       They also provide a signal to the motherboard to indicate when the DC voltages are in spec, so that the computer is able to safely power up and boot."<br>
